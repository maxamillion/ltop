# Product Requirements Document: ltop

## Overview
**ltop** is a modern Linux system monitoring tool written in Go, utilizing the Bubble Tea TUI framework to provide an interactive, real-time view of system performance metrics. It aims to combine the functionality of traditional tools like `top`, `htop`, `glances`, and `btop` with modern Go performance and Bubble Tea's elegant interface capabilities.

## Target Audience
- Linux system administrators
- DevOps engineers
- Performance engineers
- Software developers working in Linux environments
- Anyone needing comprehensive system monitoring

## Core Features

### Primary Metrics Display
1. **CPU Monitoring**
   - Per-core CPU usage percentages
   - CPU frequency information
   - Load averages (1, 5, 15 minutes)
   - CPU temperature (when available)
   - Process CPU usage breakdown

2. **Memory Monitoring**
   - RAM usage (used, free, cached, buffers)
   - Swap usage
   - Memory usage by process
   - Memory pressure indicators

3. **Storage Monitoring**
   - Disk usage per filesystem
   - I/O operations (read/write IOPS)
   - I/O bandwidth (MB/s read/write)
   - Disk queue depth
   - Storage device health indicators

4. **I/O Wait Monitoring**
   - System I/O wait percentage
   - Per-process I/O wait time
   - Block device statistics
   - Network I/O statistics

5. **System Logs & Errors**
   - Recent system log entries (last 50-100)
   - Error log highlighting
   - Configurable log sources (/var/log/syslog, journalctl, etc.)
   - Real-time log monitoring

6. **Additional System Metrics**
   - Network interface statistics (bandwidth, packets, errors)
   - System uptime and boot time
   - User sessions and processes
   - System services status
   - Container metrics (Docker/Podman when available)

### User Interface Features
1. **Interactive Navigation**
   - Keyboard shortcuts for navigation
   - Sortable process lists
   - Expandable/collapsible sections
   - Search and filter capabilities

2. **Customizable Display**
   - Multiple view modes (compact, detailed, dashboard)
   - Configurable refresh intervals
   - Color themes (dark, light, custom)
   - Metric selection and ordering

3. **Real-time Updates**
   - Configurable update intervals (1-60 seconds)
   - Smooth animations and transitions
   - Efficient data collection to minimize system impact

## Technical Requirements

### Performance
- Minimal CPU overhead (< 1% CPU usage under normal conditions)
- Low memory footprint (< 50MB RAM)
- Responsive UI with sub-second update capabilities
- Efficient data collection using Linux proc filesystem and system calls

### Compatibility
- Linux kernel 3.10+ support
- Architecture support: x86_64, ARM64
- No external dependencies beyond Go standard library and Bubble Tea
- Compatible with major Linux distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL, Debian, Arch)

### Security
- Read-only system access
- No elevated privileges required for basic functionality
- Secure handling of system information
- No network communication (local monitoring only)

## Success Metrics
- Installation and startup time < 5 seconds
- UI responsiveness with < 100ms input lag
- Accurate metric reporting (within 5% of system ground truth)
- Memory usage remains stable over extended operation
- User adoption by systems administrators

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Reliability**: Tool should run continuously without crashes
- **Usability**: Intuitive interface requiring minimal learning curve
- **Maintainability**: Clean, well-documented Go codebase
- **Portability**: Single binary deployment with no external dependencies
- **Accessibility**: Support for different terminal sizes and capabilities

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Configuration file support
- Plugin system for custom metrics
- Historical data collection and graphing
- Remote monitoring capabilities
- Integration with monitoring systems (Prometheus, etc.)
- Alert system for threshold violations
